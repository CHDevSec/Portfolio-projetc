# Network Monitoring – Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview
This document describes the architecture, deployment model, data pipelines, dashboards, alerting and security design of the Network Monitoring and Observability Platform. The system provides real‑time visibility, scalability and fault tolerance across distributed environments by integrating Grafana, Zabbix, Prometheus exporters, Wazuh, Loki, PFsense, Docker and Kubernetes.

The platform unifies metrics, logs and security analytics into a single observability stack for enterprise‑grade network visibility and performance analysis.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components
- **Grafana**: Visualization and analytics for time‑series data; correlates across Zabbix, Prometheus and Loki.
- **Zabbix Server & Agents**: Host/service telemetry (CPU, memory, disk I/O, bandwidth). Supports active/passive agents and SNMP.
- **Prometheus Exporters**: System and application metrics (Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Blackbox Exporter).
- **Wazuh Manager & Agents**: Security analytics: log ingestion, FIM, IDS, threat intelligence correlation and REST API.
- **Loki + Promtail**: Centralized log aggregation optimized for label‑based queries and Grafana Explore.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates containers, scaling, health probes and self‑healing.
- **Ingress Controller (NGINX)**: TLS termination, routing and load balancing for external/internal access.
- **PFsense**: Network segmentation, stateful firewall and secure routing between monitored sites.

### 2.2 Architectural Design
- Microservices deployment for modularity and horizontal scalability.
- Namespace isolation for monitoring workloads: `monitoring`, `logging`, `security`, `ingress-system`, `network-edge`.
- Resource limits/requests per pod and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for Grafana and Zabbix.
- Persistent storage for Zabbix DB, Loki chunks and Wazuh indices (PVC/PV).
- Configuration via ConfigMaps/Secrets; access controlled with RBAC and NetworkPolicies.

### 2.3 Data Flow Overview
- Zabbix Agents and Prometheus Exporters collect host metrics.
- Promtail ships application/system logs to Loki.
- Wazuh enriches and classifies security events (MITRE ATT&CK mapping) and exposes them via API.
- Grafana queries metrics/logs for visualization and cross‑source correlation.
- Zabbix triggers notify via webhooks (Slack/Email) and can execute remediation scripts.

## 3. Deployment Model

### 3.1 Platform Installation
- Kubernetes + Helm for declarative, modular installs; each component runs as an independent microservice.
- Rolling updates via Deployments; high availability with multi‑replica pods and node affinity.
- Secrets mounted as environment variables.

### 3.2 Namespace Design
- `monitoring`: Grafana, Zabbix, Loki core services.
- `ingress-system`: NGINX Ingress and certificate management.
- `security`: Wazuh manager/agents and alert processors.
- `network-edge`: PFsense integration endpoints and network tools.

### 3.3 Resource Management
- CPU/memory quotas per namespace for predictable performance.
- HPA for Grafana/Zabbix based on CPU and query latency.
- Persistent Volumes bound to Loki/Wazuh for durable log storage.

### 3.4 Example Commands
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/zabbix/
kubectl apply -f k8s/grafana/
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus/
```

## 4. Data Collection Pipelines

### 4.1 Host Metrics (Zabbix + Prometheus)
- Zabbix Agents collect CPU, RAM, Disk I/O and bandwidth; SNMP traps from network devices for traffic baselining.
- Triggers/thresholds drive automated alerts (e.g., CPU > 85%).
- Prometheus Node Exporter and cAdvisor provide kernel/container metrics; scrapes every 15–60s.
- Zabbix DB uses partitioned tables to support large‑scale retention.

### 4.2 Application & System Logs (Wazuh + Loki)
- Wazuh collects system (syslog/journald), application (nginx/docker/custom) and security events (FIM, IDS).
- Logs forwarded to Loki with labels (hostname, namespace, container, service) for high‑performance queries.
- Wazuh rulesets classify severity and map to MITRE; correlation ties anomalous behavior to performance degradation.

### 4.3 Network Traffic & Edge Visibility
- PFsense exports firewall logs and NetFlow to Wazuh/Loki.
- Ingress Controller emits latency, TLS failures and upstream codes—visualized in Grafana to spot bottlenecks.
- Cert‑Manager automates TLS renewal.

## 5. Observability Dashboards
- Operations: system health (CPU, memory, uptime, disk), environment filters.
- Network: bandwidth utilization, interface errors, packet loss, jitter and regional latency.
- Security: Wazuh alerts by severity, IOC detections, ATT&CK coverage.
- Zabbix Alert Overview: active triggers, severity heatmaps.
- Service Dependency Maps from Zabbix auto‑discovery.

Retention defaults: metrics 30 days (Prometheus), logs 90 days (Loki). Old data is purged by CronJobs.

## 6. Alerting & Incident Response
- Predictive analysis in Zabbix using trend functions on 24h/7d history.
- Threshold rules (CPU > 85%, Disk > 90%, Network errors > 3%) and composite triggers to reduce false positives.
- Notifications via Slack/Microsoft Teams/Email webhooks; optional Jira/ServiceNow integration.
- Auto‑remediation with remote commands (service restart, cache clear, node reboot) on critical events.

## 7. High Availability & Fault Tolerance
- Zabbix, Wazuh and Loki as StatefulSets with persistent storage.
- Dashboards and alert configs versioned in Git and deployed with GitOps (e.g., ArgoCD).
- PodDisruptionBudgets and health probes prevent interruptions during upgrades.
- NetworkPolicies restrict cross‑namespace communication.

## 8. Backup & Retention
- Wazuh indices retained for 90 days; Loki chunks compressed with time‑based retention.
- Nightly snapshots to object storage (MinIO/S3) and automated restore via Helm hooks.

## 9. Security & Compliance
- TLS 1.3 end‑to‑end using Kubernetes Secrets and certificates.
- RBAC‑based permissions in Grafana and Wazuh; least‑privilege roles in Zabbix.
- NetworkPolicies default‑deny; only required ports exposed.
- Wazuh agent enrollment signed/verified to prevent spoofing.
- Vault (optional) for secret management; image scanning with Trivy in CI.

## 10. Scalability & Performance
- HPA for Grafana, Zabbix and Prometheus components; node affinity to isolate monitoring workloads.
- Caching layers reduce query overhead; async writes improve ingestion latency.
- Proven stable up to 50k metrics/s; operational outcomes include ~60% less manual intervention and faster anomaly detection.

## 11. Future Enhancements
- OpenTelemetry Collector for unified metric/log/trace ingestion.
- Elastic Stack integration for extended SIEM analytics.
- ML‑based anomaly detection (Grafana Mimir / Prometheus Thanos).
- SOAR automation for incident response and ticket creation.

## 12. Conclusion
The platform delivers an enterprise‑grade, scalable and automated monitoring ecosystem. By combining Grafana, Zabbix, Prometheus, Loki, PFsense and Kubernetes, it enables complete visibility, proactive alerting and operational intelligence—ensuring network resilience, performance optimization and rapid incident resolution.
